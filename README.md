# Overview
This project was designed to analyze data from the most recent, and past, NBA seasons. I also wanted to learn more about the Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib libraries for Python. 

The data set contains information about each player in the NBA from 2004 till 2022, the most recent season that has concluded. (As of making this project). Using this data you can also find stats about each team in the league. The data set was published by The Devastator on Kaggle.

This Python program shows 2 graphs. The first one shows the team's average of all player's individual average scaled rating. The average scaled rating takes into account the players offensive and defensive abilities. It then rates them against all other players in the league. The second graph shows the team average of players individual average scaled rating for the Dallas Mavericks from 2004 till 2022.

# Data Analysis Results
From the first graph we learn that during the 2022 season the Boston Celtics had the highest team average scaled rating. This shows that the Celtics had the highest average player rating out of all the teams in the NBA. They are followed by the Phoenix Suns, Miami Heat, and the Golden State Warriors. This data is interesting because the Golden State Warriors, who had the 4th highest team average, won first overall in the playoffs. The Celtics, who were the highest rated team average, finished in second, losing to the Warriors in the finals. The Miami Heat, who was third highest rated, lost in the semi finals to the Celtics. The Phoenix Suns, second highest average rated score, was eliminated in the second round by the Dallas Mavericks. Ultimately from this chart, we learn that having a high average scaled rating for the team positively correlates with playoff placement but does not guarantee your final ranking. 

The second chart shows the average scaled rating for the Dallas Mavericks from 2004 till 2022. (I chose them because they are my favorite team) We learn that 2005 was the Mav's best year in terms of team average. While this was their highest rating, they only won a championship in 2011, their second highest rating. Since 2005 they have been gradually decreasing in terms of team average with some ups and downs. 

# Development Environment
Jupyter Labs was the environment I wrote this project in. It has lots of great tools that made it easy for this project. (Specifically only needing to manage one version of python and importing packages)
I also did all of my programming using the Python programming language. (Python 3, ipykernel)

# Future Work
1. Chart showing the championship team each year and their scaled average team rating.
2. Add league final ranking for the Dallas Mavericks graph.
3. Plot data about individual players.
